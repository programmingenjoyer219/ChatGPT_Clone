# ChatGPT Clone

This is a ChatGPT clone built using NEXT.JS, Firebase, SWR, Tailwind.css,
Gemini API and React-Hot-Toast. The project demonstrates how to create a real-time chat application with a clean UI and smooth user experience.

I made this project by following along Sonny Sangha in his NEXT.JS 13 + AI tutorial where he builds NEXT.JS fullstack applications integrating Open AI API.

I've modified this project to make it mobile responsive and use Gemini API
insted of Open AI API as I kept running into error code 429.
I've also changed the color scheme of the app to resemble current version of ChatGPT.
